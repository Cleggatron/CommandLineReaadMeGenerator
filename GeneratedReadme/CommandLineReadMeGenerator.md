  ## Description

  This project takes user input from the command line and render a professional Readme.md file that can be used for a repo. This will hopefully save a lot of typing out markdown. It was also a good springboard for me utilising node.js and is my first backend project.

  ## Installation

  The project can be installed by clone the project down from the code repo. One must already have Node.js installed on the computer. Then navigate to the directory and run 'npm install' in the terminal to install the dependencies (inquirer, fs, and util).

  ## Usage

  ![File In Action](../Assets/ReadmeGeneratorScreenshot.png)

  Once the dependencies are installed we can open the terminal and run 'node index.js'. The user will then be prompted by series of questions to get hte necessary content for the Readme. The questions should contain all hte information needed to input the data correctly. This will then create the file in a subfolder called GeneratedReadme. Notes: The file path for the screenshot will need to be local to the directories for the end project.
